# What's new in AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2<a name="greengrass-v2-whats-new"></a>

AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 is a new major version release of AWS IoT Greengrass\. The Version 2 release introduces the following features:

**Open source edge runtime**  
The edge runtime is now open source and distributed under the Apache 2\.0 license and available on GitHub\. You can now view the AWS IoT Greengrass edge runtime code, which allows you to troubleshoot interactions with your application and helps you build more reliable and performant applications running on AWS IoT Greengrass\. You can also customize and extend the AWS IoT Greengrass edge runtime to meet your specific hardware and software needs\. For more information, see [Open source AWS IoT Greengrass client software](open-source.md)\.

**Improved modularity**  
You can add or remove pre\-built software components based on your use cases, and your device CPU and memory resources\. For example, you can choose to include only pre\-built AWS IoT Greengrass components, such as stream manager, when you need to process data streams with your application\. Or, you can include only machine learning components when you want to perform machine learning inference locally on your devices\. For more information, see [Manage AWS IoT Greengrass components](manage-components.md) and [AWS\-provided components](public-components.md)\.

**New local development tools**  
AWS IoT Greengrass includes a new command line interface \(CLI\) that enables you to locally develop and debug applications on your device\. In addition, the new local debug console helps you visually debug applications on your device\. With these new capabilities, you can develop and debug code on a test device before using the cloud to deploy to your production devices\. For more information, see [Greengrass CLI](greengrass-cli-component.md) and [Local debug console](local-debug-console-component.md)\.

**Improved fleet deployment features**  
AWS IoT Greengrass is now integrated with AWS IoT thing groups\. This enables you to organize your devices in groups and manage application deployments across your devices with features that control rollout rates, timeouts, and rollbacks\. For more information, see [Deploy AWS IoT Greengrass components to devices](manage-deployments.md)\.

#### Public component changes<a name="greengrass-2021-03-09-components"></a>

**Important**  <a name="component-patch-update-note"></a>
<a name="component-patch-update"></a>When you deploy a component, AWS IoT Greengrass installs the latest supported versions of all component dependencies for that component\. Because of this, new patch versions of AWS\-provided public components might be automatically deployed to your core devices if you add new devices to a thing group, or you update the deployment that targets those devices\. Some automatic updates, such as a nucleus update, can cause your devices to restart unexpectedly\.   
<a name="component-version-pinning"></a>To prevent unintended updates for a component that is running on your device, we recommend that you directly include your preferred version of that component when you [create a deployment](create-deployments.md)\. For more information about update behavior for AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, see [Update the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software \(OTA\)](update-greengrass-core-v2.md)\.
