# Greengrass Command Line Interface<a name="gg-cli"></a>

The Greengrass Command Line Interface \(CLI\) lets you interact with AWS IoT Greengrass Core on your device to locally develop components and debug issues\. For example, you can use the Greengrass CLI to create a local deployment and restart a component on the core device\. 

Deploy the [Greengrass CLI component](greengrass-cli-component.md) \(`aws.greengrass.Cli`\) to install the Greengrass CLI on your core device\.

**Important**  
The Greengrass CLI is intended for use only in development environments\. Don't deploy the Greengrass CLI on production devices\.
