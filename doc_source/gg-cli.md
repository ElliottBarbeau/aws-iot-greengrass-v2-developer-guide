# Greengrass Command Line Interface<a name="gg-cli"></a>

The Greengrass Command Line Interface \(CLI\) lets you interact with AWS IoT Greengrass Core on your device to develop local components and debug issues\. For example, you can use the Greengrass CLI to create a local deployment and restart a component on the core device\. 

You must deploy the [Greengrass CLI component](greengrass-cli-component.md) \(`aws.greengrass.Cli`\) to install the Greengrass CLI on your core device\. The Greengrass CLI component is available as version 2\.0\.x\.
